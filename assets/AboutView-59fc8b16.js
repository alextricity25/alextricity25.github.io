I&#39;m a Christian, Nature Enthusiast, Software Engineer, and Husband. <br><br> I grew up most of my life in San Antonio, TX. There I attended elementary, middle, and high school. I also graduated Magna Cum Laude from my local university, University of Texas at San Antonio with a Computer Science degree. <br><br> I worked for a cloud computing company called Rackspace for a bit then attended a post-graduate Biblical studies program for two years. I&#39;m now focused on DevOps and Cloud automation work. I also focus on back-end work with Python and dabble with front-end technologies such as ReactJS and VueJS. I think it&#39;s important to develop a solid understanding of each area within Software Engineering. There are hundreds, probably even thousands of niches within Software Engineering, but the foundations are pretty much the same. During my time at Rackspace, I was lucky enough to have the oppoturnity to learn computer networking concepts. I obtained my CCNA and RCHA there, which gave me a practical handle of how enterprise systems are run. Certifications are no substitution for hard-earned experience though. <br><br> I&#39;ve deployed several private clouds, worked with many DevOps tools, help write Python-based modules and applications on top of Flask and Django, dove into the inner-workings of virtualization and software-defined networking, and I still enjoy doing these things today. I&#39;m very intrigued by how technology can help us solve today&#39;s problems. <br><br> However, this page isn&#39;t solely dedicated to my profession, which is my human responsibility to do well. This page will tell you more than just what I do by trade. It will tell you a little about the person I have become over the years and who I aspire to be. If you want to know more about my profession and trade, take a look at my resume and do not hesitate to reach out.<br><br> I faithfully pursue the Lord Jesus Christ. Not as a religion or a set of creeds and doctrines, but as a living Person who is real, active, and operating. I&#39;m not much for religion or traditions, but I love the Lord Jesus and His Word.<br><br> I enjoy learning at every new turn. I like to build things with my hands and show them off. I enjoy well-earned leisure time. I have difficulty with not doing things at times, but acknowledge that it&#39;s necessary to give your mind a break and just stop doing.<br><br> I believe in being kind to others and having a positive attitude, which makes it hard for me to understand the apparent trend in society to focus on the negative and always be worried. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s a challenge some days, but my experience tells me that I&#39;m not happy because I choose not to be. <br><br> I don&#39;t care much for politics. Nevertheless, I try my best to stay educated and do my part.<br><br> I like gardening, computers, playing video games, auto detailing, playing guitar, singing, and 3D modeling.<br><br></p></div>',2),s=[r];function d(l,h){return t(),o("div",i,s)}const c=e(n,[["render",d]]);export{c as default};
